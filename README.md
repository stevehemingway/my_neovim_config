Neovim is an amazing editor, with thousands of addins. Unfortunately, keeping them all in sync
is a nightmare, even with AI assistance. 
This set works for me. Of course, it will only work for you if you've installed the necessary
executables. Also, you may need to add language servers for languages I've never even heard of.

I am a rank amateur, but I like vi/vim/neovim, and I want to keep using it, but not forgo
the excellent additional features it has picked up over the years.
